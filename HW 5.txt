Week 5 Homework — Shunting Yard Algorithm (Infix to Postfix Conversion)

⸻

1. What is the Shunting Yard Algorithm?
 • The Shunting Yard Algorithm is a method to convert mathematical expressions from Infix notation (like a+b) to Postfix notation (Reverse Polish Notation).
 • It was invented by Edsger Dijkstra.
 • The algorithm uses a stack to hold operators and parentheses during the conversion.

2. How does it work? (Step-by-step)
 • Read the expression from left to right.
 • If the token is an operand (a letter or number), add it directly to the output.
 • If the token is an operator (such as +, -, *, /):
 • Pop operators from the stack to the output while they have higher or equal precedence.
 • Then push the current operator onto the stack.
 • If the token is a left parenthesis (, push it onto the stack.
 • If the token is a right parenthesis ), pop operators from the stack to the output until a left parenthesis ( is encountered, then discard the (.
 • After the entire input has been read, pop any remaining operators from the stack to the output.

3. Example 1: a*b+c
 • Read a → operand → output: a
 • Read * → operator → push * on stack
 • Read b → operand → output: ab
 • Read + → operator:
 • * has higher precedence → pop * to output → output: ab*
 • push + onto stack
 • Read c → operand → output: ab*c
 • End of expression → pop remaining operator + → output: ab*c+

*4. Example 2: (a+b)c
 • Read ( → push on stack
 • Read a → operand → output: a
 • Read + → operator → push + on stack
 • Read b → operand → output: ab
 • Read ) → pop operators until ( → pop + → output: ab+
 • Remove ( from stack
 • Read * → operator → push * on stack
 • Read c → operand → output: ab+c
 • End of expression → pop remaining operator * → output: ab+c*

⸻

5. Expected Output
 • For a*b+c → ab*c+
 • For (a+b)*c → ab+c*
