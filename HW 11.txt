1. How we do cluster in graph? 
We perform clustering by grouping nodes that have a high density of edges between them. This is done using two main strategies:

Agglomerative (Bottom-Up): Starting with each node as a separate cluster and merging them based on similarity.

Divisive (Top-Down): Starting with the entire graph as one cluster and recursively splitting it into smaller groups.

2. How are they separated? 
Clusters are separated by identifying and removing the edges that connect different communities (bridge edges). The main methods are:

Edge Betweenness: Removing edges that lie on the highest number of shortest paths between nodes.

Modularity Maximization: Partitioning the graph to maximize the density of internal connections versus external ones.

Normalized Cuts: Using mathematical matrices (Laplacian Matrix) to split the graph into balanced segments.
